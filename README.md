# Underwear Store Website Project
This is a website project for a store that aimed to sell underwear. The website allowed users to create orders, and a confirmation email was sent to the client's email address. The website is responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing experience.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Email notification system

  
## Project Status
Unfortunately, the business associated with this project closed after the war in Ukraine started. As a result, this project is no longer actively maintained or updated.
The website is still available for viewing from my github repository at: https://alexandermedvedevpjatk.github.io/frontend-store-ua/, but no further development is planned.

## Features
* **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to various screen sizes, enhancing user experience.
* **Photo Gallery**: A feature that showcases product images, allowing users to explore available underwear.
* **Email Notification System**: Although currently non-functional due to the business closure, this feature would have notified clients about their orders.
